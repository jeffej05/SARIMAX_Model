SARIMAX Pricing Model 

In this analysis, SARIMA and SARIMAX (holidays as the exogenous variable) forecasting models were developed/evaluated in order to predict open exchange ad prices. An ETS decomposition was constructed beforehand in order to understand the various trend/seasonal components as well as a dickey-fuller test to quantitively test for seasonality. In addition, month-plots and quarter-plots were utilized in order to when seasonality actually occurs.
