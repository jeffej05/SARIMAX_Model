SARIMAX Pricing Model 

In this analysis, SARIMA and SARIMAX (holidays as the exogenous variable) forecasting models were developed/evaluated in order to predict open exchange ad prices. An ETS decomposition was constructed beforehand in order to understand the various trend/seasonal components and a Dickey-Fuller test was used to quantitively test for seasonality. In addition, month-plots and quarter-plots were constructed in order to figure out when seasonality actually occurs.
